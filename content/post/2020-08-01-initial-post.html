<p>Hi There,</p>
<p>This is my initial post on my blog! I am excited to have a space to share my thoughts, opinions, and data explorations on the internet. I don’t do a whole lot of social media like Facebook, Twitter, etc. Although, I do Snap Chat sometimes with some friends and share on my story (<span class="citation">@alexb523</span>). So this will be a nice way to get what I think is important out there.</p>
<p>I have a wife who I enjoy spending time with. We like hiking, camping, biking, kayaking, cooking, exercising, and anything else that will get us outdoors. For example, we have been trying to get into bird watching. My dad is a really avid birder and is showing us the ropes! But we all need our space (I assume especially her from me). I myself enjoy all those activities mentioned very much, even by myself, but I also enjoy playing guitar, coding, and I am trying to get into woodworking.</p>
<p>While I really like all those things, I would say I spend most of my time coding and playing guitar. I am a data analyst and am aspiring to be a data engineer and/or data scientist. In my professional life overall, I am on the journey to be well rounded at working with data. And I work at home, so I also pick up the guitar a lot.</p>
<p>I am hoping I can use this blog for a few things:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>To just document my thoughts about life and stuff in general. Maybe that’s something nobody is interested in, but I think it will be helpful for me and maybe the spillover will help or be of interest to other people.</p></li>
<li>To “show off” my coding skills and hopefully help people in doing so. I learn a lot about coding from the internet and would love to contribute back. Not to mention, if I can point to some data topics and a website in general, I think I could impress prospective employers. The main programs I code in are <code>R</code>, <code>Python</code>, <code>SQL</code> (or <code>PostgreSQL</code>) and Excel. I would say I am a heavy <code>R</code> user, I am fluent in <code>Python</code>, and I am good at <code>SQL</code> (querying, setting up databases, giving access, etc.). I am also embarrassingly good at Excel. I hope to produce some posts in all of these languages and maybe even in some languages I learn later on.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>I say I am embarrassingly good at Excel, because ever since I started working out of my undergrad, I have enjoyed working with data. I thought everyone else in the company I worked at was good at Excel and I needed to get good at Excel to keep up with them. It turns out they were not good at Excel and I soon became known for my Excel skills. I became fascinated by the ability to automate and do things fast! The natural progression from that is coding which I was exposed to in my masters and took off from there.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>I’ll be honest, I like money. Wellll…I actually don’t like money. I hate money. Wellll…I actually just hate that you need money. What I like is freedom. And you can use money to get freedom. I am doing my darnedest to use my data skills to analyze things about money. Which includes spending, investing, and making. I will likely try to post analyses about things in the financial genre and try to shed some light on my journey to financial freedom and/or independence.</p></li>
