# In This Blog

I'd like to talk about data and analytic and the occasional random rant about things. I will try to express how to leverge data and other random thoughts eleantly.


# Professionally

I conisder myself an Experiened Data Professional. I've been drawn to data since I started my professional-working career in 2013. I became embarrising good at Excel, started creating complex queries, then developing repoducible code to automate data processing and reporting tasks in open source lanages like `Python` and `R`, as well as, cloud techonlogies like AWS.

I double majored in Supply Chain Management and Economics from the University of Northern Iowa and the got my Masters of Science from the University of Iowa.

I have interest in automation and machine learning, as well as, data strategy development and implementation.

I've worked in an elcectic of domains including distribution, k-12 standarized testing, and finance.

# Personally

While I truely enjoy working with data, and it tends to seep into all aspects of my life, I also deeply enjoy spending time with my wife and dog.

We like to get outdoors for hiking, camping, biking, kayaking, and running. I also like cooking and guitar.
