      <description>Hi ThereThis is my initial post! I am grateful to have a space to share my thoughts and data explorations.
In This BlogI’d like to talk about data and analytic and the occasional random rant about things. I will try to express data and my thoughts eleantly (but no promises).
ProfessionallyI conisder myself an Experiened Data Professional. I’ve been drawn to data since I started my professional-working career in 2013.</description>
