      <description>Hi There,
This is my initial post on my blog! I am excited to have a space to share my thoughts, opinions, and data explorations on the internet. I don’t do a whole lot of social media like Facebook, Twitter, etc. Although, I do Snap Chat sometimes with some friends and share on my story (@alexb523). So this will be a nice way to get what I think is important out there.</description>
